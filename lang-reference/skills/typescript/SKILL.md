# TypeScript

- Use `pnpm` as preferred package manager (over npm/yarn)
- Use `Bun` for CLI tool development
- Use `Vite` as bundler
- Use `Biome` for linting and formatting (over ESLint + Prettier)
- Configure strict TypeScript settings in `tsconfig.json`
- Prefer TypeScript over JavaScript
- **NEVER use `any`** - use proper type definitions
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Follow conventional project structure: `src/`, `tests/`, `dist/`
