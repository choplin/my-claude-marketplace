# Codex CLI Usage Guide

OpenAI Codex CLI is a command-line tool that provides AI-powered code assistance. This skill covers how to use Codex CLI effectively from Claude Code.

## Basic Commands

**Important**: Always use `codex-xhigh` alias which has `model_reasoning_effort="xhigh"` configured for better reasoning quality.

### Non-interactive Mode (codex-xhigh exec)

For getting quick opinions or executing prompts without interactive mode:

```bash
# Basic execution
codex-xhigh exec "your prompt here"

# Read-only sandbox (safe for reviews)
codex-xhigh exec -s read-only "Review this code and share your thoughts"

# Output to file
codex-xhigh exec -o /tmp/codex-response.txt "your prompt"

# JSON output format
codex-xhigh exec --json "your prompt"
```

### Code Review Mode (codex-xhigh review)

For reviewing code changes:

```bash
# Review uncommitted changes
codex-xhigh review --uncommitted

# Review changes against a base branch
codex-xhigh review --base main

# Review specific files
codex-xhigh review path/to/file.ts
```

## Best Practices for Getting Opinions

1. **Use read-only sandbox** for safety: `-s read-only`
2. **Be specific** in your prompts about what kind of feedback you want
3. **Provide context** about the codebase or design goals
4. **Capture output** using `-o` or `--json` for structured responses

## Example Prompts

### Code Review
```bash
# Codex can read files directly - just provide the path
codex-xhigh exec -s read-only "Review src/utils/parser.ts for potential bugs and improvements"
```

### Design Discussion
```bash
codex-xhigh exec -s read-only "What are the pros and cons of using Redux vs React Context for state management in a medium-sized React application?"
```

### Architecture Opinion
```bash
codex-xhigh exec -s read-only "Review this API design and suggest improvements:

GET /users/{id}/posts
POST /users/{id}/posts
DELETE /posts/{id}

Should we restructure these endpoints?"
```

## Output Interpretation

Codex responses typically include:
- **Analysis**: Understanding of the code/problem
- **Suggestions**: Specific improvements or alternatives
- **Concerns**: Potential issues or risks identified
- **Code examples**: When applicable, concrete code suggestions
