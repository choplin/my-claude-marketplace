# Post Task

Capture knowledge from the completed task. This is the final step after commit.

## Purpose

Preserve valuable learnings from the session before they are lost to session clear.

## Trigger

After commit is completed. The workflow is:

```
self-review → user review → commit → post-task
```

## Process

### 1. Session Review

Review what happened during the session to identify knowledge worth preserving:

- External information researched (sources matter)
- Patterns that appeared 2+ times in the session
- Domain knowledge shared by user
- Project-specific conventions discovered
- Decisions made during implementation
- Specs/plans with lasting value
- Review feedback patterns (from review.md if exists)

### 2. Propose Knowledge Capture

Present a list of items to capture, categorized by type:

| Signal | Proposal | Destination |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Researched external information | Capture with sources | CLAUDE.md or Skill |
| Same workflow appeared 2+ times | Package as Skill | Skill |
| User shared domain knowledge | Make reusable | Skill |
| Project-specific knowledge or code snippets | Document | CLAUDE.md |
| Decision future developers should know | Create ADR | docs/adr/ |
| Spec/plan has lasting value | Preserve as Design Doc | docs/ |

### 3. User Approval

Present the proposal list. User selects which items to capture.

### 4. Execute

For each approved item:

- **Skill**: Invoke skill-authoring skill for proper skill creation
- **CLAUDE.md**: Append to appropriate section
- **ADR**: Create in docs/adr/ following ADR format
- **Design Doc**: Copy spec/plan to docs/ with appropriate naming

## Output Format

```markdown
## Knowledge Capture Proposal

Based on this session, I recommend capturing the following:

### Skill Candidates

1. **{topic}**: {why it should be a skill}
   - Source: {where this knowledge came from}

### CLAUDE.md Additions

1. **{topic}**: {what to add}
   - Section: {target section in CLAUDE.md}

### ADR Candidates

1. **{decision}**: {why it's worth recording}
   - Context: {what led to this decision}

### Design Doc Candidates

1. **{spec/plan}**: {why it has lasting value}
   - Location: `.claude/dev-workflow/story/{name}/spec.md`

Which items would you like me to capture?
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All valuable learnings from session are identified
- [ ] Each proposal includes rationale (why it's worth capturing)
- [ ] User can select which items to capture
- [ ] Selected items are properly created in their destinations

## Next Session

After post-task completes:

**If part of Epic**:
- **Reference**: `.claude/dev-workflow/epic/{name}/epic.md`
- **Next phase**: `create-spec` for next Story

**If standalone Story/Task**:
- **Reference**: None
- **Next phase**: Done (or start new task with `/dev-workflow:kickoff`)
