# Create Plan Document

Create an implementation plan document based on a spec.

## Purpose

Three core functions:
1. **Implementation steps**: Organize How into sequential steps
2. **Change locations**: Identify which files to modify
3. **Progress tracking**: Track completion of steps during implementation

## Detail Level

Plan should contain **steps and files only**:
- What to do (step description)
- Which files to change

**Why this level?**
- **Focus on direction**: AI is capable enough that if it knows what to do, it can handle implementation. Plan should focus on direction and goal.
- **Flexibility**: Too much detail makes the plan brittle/fragile - implementation often evolves differently
- **Review cost**: More detail means more to review (same problem as create-spec)

**Exception**: For repetitive tasks, few-shot examples can be included to guide implementation style.

Plan should NOT contain:
- Specific code changes
- Function/class level details
- Implementation code snippets

## Input

This skill is invoked after create-spec completes. The spec document at `.claude/dev-workflow/story/{name}/spec.md` is the input.

## Process

### 1. Read Spec

Load the spec document and understand:
- Why: Background and motivation
- What: Requirements and acceptance criteria
- Out of Scope: What NOT to do

### 2. Investigate Codebase

Gather information needed for implementation:
- Existing code structure
- Files that need changes
- Existing patterns to follow

### 3. Design Implementation Steps

Create steps following these principles:
- **Dependency-aware**: Start with prerequisites
- **One deliverable per step**: Each step produces a clear result
- **Verifiable**: Completion can be confirmed

### 4. Create Plan Document

Create `.claude/dev-workflow/story/{name}/plan.md`:

```markdown
# Plan: {title}

## Related Files

- **Workflow concepts**: `dev-workflow/docs/workflow-concepts.md`
- **Spec**: `.claude/dev-workflow/story/{name}/spec.md`
- **Epic**: `.claude/dev-workflow/epic/{parent}/epic.md` (if part of an Epic)

## Approach
{High-level implementation approach}

## Files to Change

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `path/to/file` | {brief description} |

## Steps

### Step 1: {name}
{What to do}

### Step 2: {name}
{What to do}

## Progress

- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2

## Notes
{Decisions made during planning, if any}
```

### 5. User Review

Present plan to user for approval before proceeding.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Plan document is created at `.claude/dev-workflow/story/{name}/plan.md`
- [ ] Spec is referenced
- [ ] Files to change are listed
- [ ] Steps are in dependency order
- [ ] Progress checklist exists
- [ ] Implementation can start by reading plan alone (/clear and go)
- [ ] User has approved the plan

## Next Action

After plan is approved:
- Session can be cleared
- Load spec + plan and start implementation
- Update Progress section as steps complete
