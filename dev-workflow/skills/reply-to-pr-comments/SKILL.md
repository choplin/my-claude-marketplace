# Reply to PR Comments

Generate reply drafts for PR review comments imported via `import-pr-comments`, and optionally post them.

**Trigger phrases**: "reply to PR comments", "PRコメントに返信", "返信案を作って", "draft PR replies"

## Purpose

After addressing review items imported from a PR, the developer needs to reply to each comment on the PR. This skill automates drafting those replies with consistent, concise formatting and accurate commit references.

## Input

- `review.md` containing items with a `Source` field (PR-imported items)
- Git log for commit references

## Process

### 1. Locate review.md and PR

1. **Find review.md** at:
   - `.claude/dev-workflow/story/*/review.md`
   - `.claude/dev-workflow/task/*/review.md`

   - If not found: stop and report "review.md not found."

2. **Extract PR info**: Parse PR number from Source fields (e.g., `PR #42 comment:123`).

3. **Derive owner/repo**: Run `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner'`.

### 2. Collect Unreplied Items

1. Read all Review Items that have a `Source` field containing `PR #`.
2. Read the metadata comment at the end of review.md:
   ```
   <!-- replied-pr-comments: ["id1","id2",...] -->
   ```
3. Filter out items whose comment ID is already in the replied list.
4. If no unreplied items remain: report "All PR comments have been replied to." and stop.

### 3. Resolve Commit References

For items that were addressed with code changes:

1. Run `git log --oneline` on the current branch to get recent commits.
2. For each resolved item, identify the commit that addressed it:
   - Match by files changed: cross-reference the item's File field with `git log --name-only`
   - If multiple commits touch the same file, prefer the commit whose message relates to the item
3. Store the short commit SHA (7 characters) for use in the reply.

### 4. Generate Reply Drafts

For each unreplied item, generate a reply based on its resolution:

#### Addressed with code changes

Format: what was done + commit reference.

```
{one-sentence description of what was changed}. Fixed in {sha}.
```

#### Addressed without code changes

For items where no code change was needed (e.g., already handled, configuration-only, documentation clarification):

```
{one-sentence explanation of resolution}.
```

#### Not acted upon

For items intentionally declined or deferred:

```
{reason why this was not addressed}.
```

### 5. Present Drafts

Present all drafts to the user for review:

```markdown
## PR Comment Reply Drafts

**PR**: #{number}
**Unreplied items**: {count}

| # | Item | Reply |
|---|------|-------|
| {N} | {item summary} | {draft reply} |
| {N} | {item summary} | {draft reply} |

Edit any drafts, then say "post" to submit replies to the PR.
```

Wait for user input.

### 6. Post Replies (on explicit request only)

**Only proceed when the user explicitly requests posting** (e.g., "post", "投稿して", "submit").

For each reply:

1. Parse the comment ID from the Source field: `PR #{number} comment:{commentId}`

2. **For inline comments** (Source contains `(inline)`):
   - Use `mcp__github__add_reply_to_pull_request_comment` with:
     - `owner`, `repo`: from step 1
     - `pullNumber`: PR number
     - `commentId`: parsed comment ID
     - `body`: the reply text

3. **For review body comments** (Source contains `(review-body)`):
   - Use `mcp__github__add_issue_comment` with:
     - `owner`, `repo`: from step 1
     - `issue_number`: PR number
     - `body`: `@{author} {reply text}` (mention the reviewer for context)

4. **Update replied tracking**: After successful posting, update the metadata comment at the end of review.md:
   ```
   <!-- replied-pr-comments: ["id1","id2","newId1"] -->
   ```

5. **Report results**:
   ```markdown
   {count} replies posted to PR #{number}.
   ```

## Reply Style Guide

- **Be concise**: one line is ideal, two lines maximum
- **No pleasantries**: skip "Thank you for the review", "Good catch", etc.
- **Commit references**: use short SHA (7 chars), e.g., `abc1234`
- **Declined items**: state the reason directly without being defensive
- **Language**: match the language of the original comment

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

| Anti-pattern | Why It's Wrong | Correct Behavior |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| Posting without explicit request | User needs to review and edit drafts first | Always present drafts and wait for "post" signal |
| Verbose replies | Adds noise to PR conversation | Keep replies to 1-2 lines |
| Adding pleasantries | Wastes reviewer's time | State facts only |
| Guessing commit references | Wrong commit ref is worse than none | Only include commit SHA when confidently matched |
| Replying to already-replied comments | Creates duplicate replies | Check replied-pr-comments metadata |
